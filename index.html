                        Triceratops lived in the late Cretaceous Period (around 65 million years ago). The Triceratops is one
                        of the most easily recognizable dinosaurs due to its large body, unique frill and three horns. It
                        needed its three horns to try and protect itself from the Tyrannosaurus Rex which lived during the
                        same time period.Why did the Triceratops have such a prominent frill? As with all such anatomical
                        structures in the animal kingdom, this thin flap of skin over solid bone likely served a dual (or
                        even triple) purpose. The most probable explanation is that it was used to signal other members of
                        the herd. A brightly colored frill, flushed pink by the numerous blood vessels under its surface,
                        may have signaled sexual availability or warned of the approach of a hungry Tyrannosaurus rex. It
                        may also have had some temperature-regulation function, assuming that the Triceratops was
                        cold-blooded.
